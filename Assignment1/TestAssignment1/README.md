### Thoughts on BDD:

#### What was positive and good about using BDD?
The good thing about BDD is that you learn to understand the case or problem more before coding it. You have to invent the case beforehand and think of how it will operate. Then you test the functionality and correctness, so you know the functions work as they should based on the requirement specification.
#### What was annoying or difficult?
It was a little annoying that we had to make the test fail at first. It was difficult not to give in to just write the code and test it afterwards.
#### What surprised you?
That it was actually not so unmanageable than we thought it would be. Because we new what the methods should do then we could write the tests beforehand.
#### Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more
Yes. With the feature testing we could work on the best user experience and think of giving the problem an actual case with a fixed number to test with.
#### Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?
Yes, Given, When, Then test. For this case we would only have made unit tests with TDD if we didnøt have to feature test as well.
